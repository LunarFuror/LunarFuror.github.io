My name is Grayson Lorenz, and I make PWA Apps.\n  I've been a programmer ever since I started my first class in highschool back in 2006. I've been professionally employed as a developer since 2015.\n  I specialize in Vue, React, and Node. Of course that comes with the surrounding skills of HTML, CSS, Express, PSQL, MySQL, etc. \n\n  About my handle Lunar Furor: When I learned the word furor it meant fury... no wait, when I first saw the word way back in 2005, it was because of the AC/DC song \"The Furor\" on the Ballbreaker album, and I thought it was rad.\n  I came up with it because I've always had an interest and love for the moon and night. So Lunar was a pretty cool word. Also as stated, AC/DC was rad, so I slapped Furor on there. As a young teen with a really rocky upbringing I was up at night a lot, and I was angry a lot, made sense.\n  These days I've calmed down, got my house in order, learned a profession, and built a woodshop, the fury at night doesn't fit as much so the name has changed meanings for me.\n  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/furor \n  So, to me, the name represents my facination with the moon still. I'm excited to see full moons, I love seeing it go through it's phases, and in the winter it is amazing to see how bright it can be at night with nothing but the light of the moon.\n  I've used the name since '05 and have used it for just about everything, so I'm not yet willing to change it. Though often I simply will shorten it to Lunar.\n\n  As you go through the apps here, this info box will update to show the info for each app.\n    -Grayson"})}}]),e}(u["c"]);p=h["a"]([u["a"]],p);var g=p,m=g,d=(a("c95b"),a("2877")),w=Object(d["a"])(m,n,o,!1,null,null,null);e["default"]=w.exports},"7e05":function(t,e,a){},c95b:function(t,e,a){"use strict";var n=a("7e05"),o=a.n(n);o.a}}]);
